# facenet-pytorch-vggface2 (Under Development, use at your own risk)

__Operating System__: Ubuntu 18.04 (you may face issues importing the packages from the requirements.yml file if your OS differs).

A PyTorch implementation  of the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) [[1](#references)] paper for training a facial recognition model using Triplet Loss. Training is done on the [VGGFace2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/) [[2](#references)] dataset containing 3.3 million face images based on over 9000 human identities.
Evaluation is done on the Labeled Faces in the Wild [[3](#references)] dataset. Please note there are overlapping identities between the two datasets since both are based on human celebrities (500 identities), __overlapping identities were not removed from the training dataset in this implementation__.
 
 A pre-trained model on tripet loss with an accuracy of __97.65%__ on the LFW dataset is provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X83B9QMJ7AyodNTDtFXF0YiSfn1mV63j/view?usp=sharing).

Please let me know if you find mistakes and errors, or improvement ideas for the code and for future training experiments. Feedback would be greatly appreciated as this is still work in progress.

### Pre-trained model

Link to download the pre-trained model using Triplet Loss [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X83B9QMJ7AyodNTDtFXF0YiSfn1mV63j/view?usp=sharing).


### Pre-trained Model LFW Test Metrics
__Note__: The available pre-trained model was not trained according to the current training method of triplet batches being constrained to a set number of human identities. The training method used for training this model could be seen by checking to older commits. __A new pre-trained model using the current training method will be uploaded hopefully soon__.

### How to import and use the model
1. Download the model (.pt) file from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X83B9QMJ7AyodNTDtFXF0YiSfn1mV63j/view?usp=sharing) above into your project.
2. Import the 'resnet.py' and 'utils_resnet.py' modules from the 'models' folder.
3. Create a new folder in your project ('model' in this example).
4. Move the 'resnet.py', 'utils_resnet.py', and the 'model_resnet18_triplet.pt' files into the newly created 'model' folder.
5. Instantiate the model like the following example: 

```
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import cv2
from model.resnet import Resnet18Triplet

checkpoint = torch.load('model/model_resnet18_triplet.pt')
model = Resnet18Triplet(embedding_dimension=checkpoint['embedding_dimension'])
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
best_distance_threshold = checkpoint['best_distance_threshold']

flag_gpu_available = torch.cuda.is_available()

if flag_gpu_available:
    device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")

model.to(device)
model.eval()

preprocess = transforms.Compose([
  transforms.ToPILImage(),
  transforms.Resize(size=224),  # Pre-trained model uses 224x224 input images
  transforms.ToTensor(),
  transforms.Normalize(
      mean=[0.6068, 0.4517, 0.3800],  # Normalization settings for the model, the calculated mean and std values
      std=[0.2492, 0.2173, 0.2082]     # for the RGB channels of the tightly-cropped VGGFace2 face dataset
  )
])

img = cv2.imread('face.jpg')  # Or from a cv2 video capture stream

# Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color
img = img[:, :, ::-1]

img = preprocess(img)
img = img.unsqueeze(0)
img = img.to(device)

embedding = model(img)

# Turn embedding Torch Tensor to Numpy array
embedding = embedding.cpu().detach().numpy()

```


### Data Preparation Steps
1. Download the VGGFace2 [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/).
2. Download the Labeled Faces in the Wild [dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#download).  
3. For face alignment for both VGGFace2 and LFW datasets; I used David Sandberg's face alignment script via MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) from his 'facenet' [repository](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet):
 Steps to follow [here](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Classifier-training-of-inception-resnet-v1#face-alignment) and [here](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Validate-on-LFW#4-align-the-lfw-dataset).
 I used --image_size 224 --margin 0 for the VGGFace2 and LFW datasets. Running 6 python processes on the VGGFace2 dataset took around 13 hours on an i9-9900KF Intel CPU overclocked to 5 GHz. I then put both train and test folders into one folder and removed the extra files 
 resulting from the script (bounding box text files). 

### Model Training
__Notes__: 
* Training triplets will be generated at the beginning of each epoch and will be saved in the 'datasets/generated_triplets' directory as numpy files that can be loaded at the beginning of an epoch to start training without having to do the triplet generation step from scratch if required (see the __--training_triplets_path argument__).
* Each triplet batch will be constrained to a number of human identities (see the __--num_human_identities_per_batch__ argument).
* The number of required Python processes to be spawned to generate triplets in parallel to speed up the process can also be specified using the (__--num_generate_triplets_processes__) argument, the __default value of 0__ would generate an amount of processes equal to the amount of __available CPU cores__.

1. Generate a csv file containing the image paths of the dataset by navigating to the datasets folder and running generate_csv_files.py:

    __Note__: This step is not needed if the __VGGFace2 dataset__ was face cropped using the MTCNN method described above with the default MTCNN settings, the csv file 'vggface2_full.csv' is already available in the 'datasets' directory. Be aware that the MTCNN face cropping process would eliminate some images from the full dataset.
    ```
    usage: generate_csv_files.py [-h] --dataroot DATAROOT [--csv_name CSV_NAME]
    
    Generating csv file for triplet loss!
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --dataroot DATAROOT, -d DATAROOT
                            (REQUIRED) Absolute path to the dataset folder to
                            generate a csv file containing the paths of the images
                            for triplet loss.
      --csv_name CSV_NAME   Required name of the csv file to be generated.
                            (default: 'vggface2.csv')
    ```

2. Type in ```python train_triplet_loss.py -h``` to see the list of training options.
__Note__: '--dataroot' and '--lfw' arguments are required.

3. To train run ```python train_triplet_loss.py --dataroot "absolute path to dataset folder" --lfw "absolute path to LFW dataset folder"```

4. To resume training from a model checkpoint run ```python train_triplet_loss.py --resume "path to model checkpoint: (model.pt file)" --dataroot "absolute path to dataset folder" --lfw "absolute path to LFW dataset folder"```

5. (Optional) To __resume training from a model checkpoint__ but with __skipping the triplet generation process for the first epoch__ if the triplets file was already generated; run:
```python train_triplet_loss.py --training_triplets_path "datasets/generated_triplets/[name_of_file_here].npy" --resume "path to model checkpoint: (model.pt file)" --dataroot "absolute path to dataset folder" --lfw "absolute path to LFW dataset folder"```
