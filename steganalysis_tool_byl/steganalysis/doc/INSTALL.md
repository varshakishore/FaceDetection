### Install

You can install Aletheia with the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia
```

But some things might not work properly, because Aletheia has externar denpendencies.

Aletheia uses Octave so you need to install it and some of its libraries. You will find the dependencies in the octave-requirements.txt file. In Debian based Linux distributions you can install the dependencies with the following commands. For different distros you can deduce the appropriate ones.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install octave octave-image octave-signal
```

You can find other dependencies in the other-requirements.txt.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install liboctave-dev imagemagick
```

After that, you can execute Aletheia with:

```bash
$ ./aletheia.py 

./aletheia.py <command>
